SPLV 2023 is scheduled to run one full week: noon on **Monday 24 July** to noon on **Friday 28 July**.  Lectures will run face-to-face on-site, in the Jack Cole building in the North Haugh campus. We will use the SPLS Zulip for online communications (e.g. for questions, arrival/dinner on Sunday, …).

SPLV 2023 is kindly sponsored by the [Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance](https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/).
