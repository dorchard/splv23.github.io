# SPLV23: Scottish Programming Languages and Verification Summer School, 2023

This year, the Scottish Programming Languages and Verification Summer School will be held in St Andrews. The event is organized by the School of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews.

SPLV 2023 is scheduled to run one full week: noon on Monday 24 July to noon on Friday 28 July.  Lectures will run face-to-face on-site (in the Jack Cole building in the North Haugh campus). We will use the SPLS Zulip for online communications (e.g. for questions, arrival/dinner on Sunday, …).

SPLV 2023 is kindly sponsored by the Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance.

## Prerequisites: 

The school is aimed at PhD students in programming languages,  verification and related areas. Also, researchers and practitioners will be very welcome, as will strong master’s students with the support of a supervisor. Participants will need to have a background in computer science, mathematics or a related discipline, and have basic familiarity with (functional) programming and logic. 

## Registration:

The registration fee covers course attendance, coffee breaks and lunches. The registration fees are:

* General Registration: £100
* PhD students at Scottish Universities: £0 (Thanks to our generous sponsorship from the Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance)

## Accommodation: 

We have reserved a block for 5-night accommodation (Sunday to Friday) in student dorms, at £49 per night per person.
